# RealWorld-DSAI-Ledger

A hands-on, structured notebook archive for the Course [Data Science, Analytics & AI for Business: The Real-World Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-analytics-ai-for-business-the-real-world/).

## Purpose
This repository chronicles my learning journey through real-world business applications of data science, analytics, and artificial intelligence. It emphasizes practical insights over academic abstraction - grounded in case-based, decision-oriented learning.

## Format
All notes, exercises, and case explorations are maintained as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for clarity, reproducibility, and interactivity.

## Focus Areas
- Practical data science workflows in business settings
- Real-world AI use cases and strategic analytics
- Decision intelligence powered by data models

## Status
> Currently in progress - notebooks will be updated progressively as the course unfolds.
